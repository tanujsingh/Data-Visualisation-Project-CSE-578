**Backend** needs to be running to use APIs. 
Follow instructions from the **readme** file in the root folder. Once that is started, APIs can be used.

For starting **Frontend**: 

i) Open one terminal in the root project directory **VAST-2019-MC1-Sravani** and change directory to the Frontend from the root directory i.e., VAST-2019-MC1-Sravani using the following command: 
```bash
cd Frontend
```

 ii) Now start the python local server using the command depending on your configuration.
```bash
python3 -m http.server (or) py -3 -m http.server (or) python -m http.server
```
  iii) Now, we should see a message **"Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ..."** which indicates the successful start of the python server and the Frontend.
